SemantiKoha

* GOALS

The short term goals of this project is to: 

- Harvest bibliographich records (in the NORMARC format) from Koha, convert 
  them to RDF (with https://github.com/digibib/marc2rdf) and store the RDF in
  a triplestore. 
- Create proof-of-concept scripts to enhance the converted bibliographic data
  in the triplestore with data from other sources. 
- Enrich the Koha OPAC with the data from the triplestore. 

The long term goals is to have this functionality baked into Koha proper.

The even longer term goal is to undermine the MARC family of standards and 
replace them with Linked Data and Semantic Web technologies.
