SemantiKoha

The goal of this project is to: 

- Harvest bibliographich records (in the NORMARC format) from Koha, convert 
  them to RDF (with https://github.com/digibib/marc2rdf) and store the RDF in
  a triplestore. 
- Create proof-of-concept scripts to enhance the converted bibliographic data
  in the triplestore with data from other sources. 
- Enrich the Koha OPAC with the data from the triplestore.
